# Tech Elevator Bootcamp Final Capstone

This project was the final capstone project before we completed the Tech Elevator Bootcamp. My team consisted of three others & myself. Together we created a fully functional web application called "Cosmic Comics". As there were four of us, my contributions were primarily to the front-end development--although we often colaborated with the back-end (& they front-end) as we were a team who needed to help each other through sticky situations. 

The time span of this project stretched two weeks in an Agile formated environment. We had daily meetings with a Scrum Master (our instructor) & bi-weekly meetings with our "Product Owner" (another Tech Elevator Staff member). Utilizing PostgreSQL we locally hosted a database. Utilizing Java Spring Boot through IntelliJ IDEA we worked on the back-end. Lastly, utilizing VS code alongside Vue.js, we worked on the front-end.

To create this webpage we utilized Marvel’s public comic data (API) which allows users to explore Marvel’s comic universe. This application allows users to browse through Marvel comics & create their own personal collections of comics. Users can register, sign in, browse, & create collections. The homepage showcases a few popular comics as well. 

As this was my final project in the bootcamp, it pushed my limits everyday with new issues, new things to learn, & collaborating with a team to create one whole funcitoning webpage. Although stressful, I learned so much about myself & genuinely had so much fun creating this with my team. Hope you enjoy checking out Cosmic Comics!
